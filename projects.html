                <p>Implemented an Artificial Intelligence model capable of playing heads up no limit Texas-Holdem. This is done using a type of reinforcement learning technique counterfactual regret minimization.
                    Since Poker is a game with incomplete information, the machine learning model trains itself by playing the game with itself, evaluating all the different decisions they could have taken, and decide on their ideal strategy on each specific game state based on the resulting outcome.</p>

                <p>Designed a reaction time game based on pressing a button every time a note in a song is played with a variety of song choices ranging in difficulty. Interfaced the game with an FRDM-KL46Z microcontroller using UART communication protocol and utilizing hardware peripherals on the board such as timers and buttons.</p>
