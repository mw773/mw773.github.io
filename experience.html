            <h2>Software Engineer Intern At Coinbase</h2>
            <h4>May 2023 - September 2023, Remote</h4>
            <p>Optimized the PDF conversion speed for monthly statements of clients from HTML format reducing conversion time by an average of 80% for the institutional service Coinbase Prime on the Reporting and Monetization team.</p>
            <p>Completed an intensive three-week boot camp learning about Coinbase technologies and cryptocurrency and finished a capstone project consisting of a watchlist that displays the movement of prices for cryptocurrencies of the userâ€™s choice. Improved the reliability and user experience of Coinbase Prime through troubleshooting issues and improved the design based on internal and client feedback using TypeScript and React.</p>
            <p>Some of the skills I developed throughout my internship are utilizing a variety of tools and working with a large codebase. My project focused on editting an extensive codebase, and I learned how to use tools such as Datadog and Snowflake to facilitate testing. I coded in Golang and Javascript for this internship</p>

            <h2>Software Engineer Intern At Visa</h2>
            <h4>May 2022 - August 2022, Foster City, California</h4>
            <p>Developed a web application that parses and analyzes logs from a Splunk database into human-readable information using Go under the Open VisaNet team by coding in proprietary intelligence and retrieving data from external APIs. </p>
            <p>Created an interactive front-end providing filtering, color coding, and PDF conversion options using Go and HTML/CSS/ JavaScript from the translated data and provide additional annotations based on previously analyzed patterns and tailored tool from developer feedback saving over 90% of the time previously needed to interpret log data and spot errors.</p>
            <p>For my internship project I developed a tool from front-end to back-end, utilizing many of my backend skills along with my user interface design. I primarily coded in Golang for this internship and learned about agile development.</p>
